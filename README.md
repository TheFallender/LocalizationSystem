# UniLoc - Universal Localization
A localization system that aims to be simple but powerful, allowing you to make the changes across any language.

This repository started as a University project and is being updated to be released as a separate version on the asset store. If you have any suggestions for features be sure to contact me!

This project started usign the Editor API of Unity 2019.4, if it gets updated and something breaks, I'll be sure to fix it as soon as possible.

## Dependencies

The only dependency would be using Unity 2019.4+. I have not tested it on earlier versions of Unity so they are unsuported.

## License
This repository has an Apache License, be sure to check it out. Remember that this license only aplies to the public version of Universal Localization (this one). The asset store version works under a different license and terms.
